<p>Paintball: My first game of paintball was with a group of friends in high school and I have continued to play several times each year since. I've also made great friends over the years including two of my groomsmen. In 2000 I opened a paintball retail store in Coralville and a playing field in West Liberty, IA the following year. Both businesses were retired in 2014 but I continue to play.</p>

<p>Traveling: The first trip I planned completely on my own was to Las Vegas which included rock scrambling, kayaking from the base of the Hoover Dam, Jeep off-roading and taking in some shows. Since then I have put together trips to Hawaii, Chicago, Dallas, St Louis and Omaha. Currently my wife and I are planning a trip to Puerto Rico in 2015 for our one year anniversary. I hope to visit Iceland and New Zealand someday. </p>

<p>Movies: Both my sisters and I worked at movie theaters in our teens, therefore our family went to a lot of free movies. I also watch many movies via Netflix and dvds checked out from the library. I love to quote movies and answer movie trivia.  </p>
